        Deployed the project on vercel ( https://digihippo-jade.vercel.app/).
        Changed the title and description of the project in ' layout.tsx 'file.
        By default in next 14 all components are  rendered server-side
        Config folder:  we keep all our config objects that are important for our project instead of declaring objects anywhere and everywhere.
        ctrl+D : we can select many of the same text and change the values for all of them at once.

        npm add express  and  npm add -D @types/express  
        npm add cross-env :  lets us work with same environment variables on diffrent platforms 
         npm add @payloadcms/richtext-slate  @payloadcms/bundler-webpack @payloadcms/db-mongodb 
         Explanation :
                        @payloadcms/richtext-slate:This package seems to be related to the Payload CMS and provides a rich text editor 
                        component based on the Slate.js framework.

                        @payloadcms/richtext-slate package likely contains components and utilities for working with rich text in 
                        Payload CMS using Slate.js.

                        @payloadcms/bundler-webpack:This package appears to be related to the Payload CMS and is likely a webpack
                         bundler configuration specifically tailored for Payload projects.It might include webpack configuration 
                         settings, plugins, and loaders optimized for building Payload CMS applications.

                        @payloadcms/db-mongodb:This package seems to be another Payload CMS-related package, specifically for MongoDB integration.
                        It likely provides functionality to interact with MongoDB databases in the context of a Payload CMS project.
