        Deployed the project on vercel ( https://digihippo-jade.vercel.app/).
        Changed the title and description of the project in ' layout.tsx 'file.
        By default in next 14 all components are  rendered server-side
        Config folder:  we keep all our config objects that are important for our project instead of declaring objects anywhere and everywhere.
        ctrl+D : we can select many of the same text and change the values for all of them at once.
